<p><strong>Briefly: Intercultural studies</strong><br><br>
To introduce the reader to the context of my study field, I would like to define what interculturality
is. Dietz (2018) describes <b>interculturality</b> as “the relations that exist between the culturally
diverse human groups that comprise a given society” (1). This term should not be mixed with the term
<b>multiculturalism</b> - “the belief that different cultures within a society should all be given
importance” (Cambridge Dictionary). Studying interculturality presupposes the importance of
multiculturalism, as researchers in the field value multicultural realities of our ever-more
socially and globally connected world. Rozbicki (2015) believes that those relations of different
people are “ultimately a relation of difference”, and that those different cultural realities were
never “universal” but, on the contrary, “conventional, generated” (1),- therefore, it is important
to study <b>difference, otherness</b> in the study field alongside <b>the changes</b> that cultures go through
during their existence.<br><br>
As a researcher in the field, I have the responsibility to look at cultures
with the perspective that they have been constantly developing and were never static - which is why
Hofstede, who created a categorization system for analyzing national cultures from all over the world,
eventually lost humanitarians’ respect for his “<b>‘othering’ Hofstedean approaches</b>” (Ybema, 37). That
happened because such functionalist and reductionistic approaches lost their popularity and became
cancelled due to recognizing that a group of people in a nation cannot have “the collective
programming of the mind that distinguishes the members of one group or category of people from
others” (Hofstede, qtd. in Ybema 38). Such critique eventually created a more “flexible interpretive
space” (Ailon, qtd. in Ybema 39), which abolished the perception of “the native’s point of view”,
although Hofstede’s uncritical method still gets attraction due to their “affordable answers to
existing corporate needs” (43).</p>
