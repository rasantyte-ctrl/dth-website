<p><strong>Digital technologies & intercultural studies</strong><br><br>
In this chapter I will focus on one of the ways to currently use digital technologies within the field:
while being a student / researcher. I will not take into account the ways to use it while applying
knowledge from the field in the workplace, because, after graduation from such a university program,
each work situation may be different, and the use of digital technologies may differ drastically.
Additionally, my narrow view and lack of experience could lead to overgeneralization or an overly
black-and-white vision to things.<br><br>
During my studies in Aarhus University, in daily life I have always noticed that the students have the
freedom to choose which technological devices they want to use in class. <b>A laptop or a digital tablet</b>
can be useful to have in the classroom, but it is not mandatory - although writing often lengthy papers
requires having a physically comfortable way to prepare those digital hand-ins. We also need <b>internet
access</b> to open <b>“BrightSpace” or “WISEflow”</b> in order to access information about courses or exams - for
that we also need to have our individual profiles created by the university. Our accounts allow us to
go through <b>APIs</b> (or Application Programming Interfaces) to access important information as we log in
to those websites’ personal accounts via our university emails and passwords. Moreover, to access
certain articles or study books in “AU Library”, we need to prove that we are students, so certain
identifying information is passed through the <b>“WAYF”</b> (“Where are you from”) <b>interface</b>. Using <b>uCloud</b>
can help protect files and work progress, but, in my humble opinion, it is not necessary or it can
easily be constituted by using <b>“Google Docs”</b> / another similar website that allows one to write text
and save progress immediately on the cloud. Although using uCloud can be safer than relying on
“Google” services: for example, Vienna University “strongly advises against using external cloud
services, such as Dropbox, Google Drive” or others as they provide “u:cloud” service (Vienna
University Computer Center). I will draw an assumption that it must be due to possible security
or privacy issues.<br><br>
It may seem that there are some freedoms in regards to using digital technologies for our studies, but
it is only an illusion due to our dependence on information not only in theoretical articles and study
books, but in studying people’s behaviours in social media. “We No Longer Go Online, We Live Online”
(Chorn) is an insightful saying, which will force students and researchers to follow various groups’
activities <b>online</b> in order to find relevant problems and access to people.
