<p><strong>New possible technological disruptions to the field’s practices</strong><br><br>
As mentioned in the previous chapter, more and more information can be found online as people not only are,
but <i>live</i> in online spaces. One of the biggest threats that I can notice to the field is <b>difficulties to obtain
trustworthy information</b>. Misinformation, disinformation and mal-information are not new concepts, but I believe that
new technologies (ex. deep-fakes) can make it progressively more difficult to find reliable information as technology
improves. The main difference between the previously mentioned terms is that <b>misinformation</b> is something false that
a person spreads while <i>believing</i> in it; meanwhile <b>disinformation</b> is any information that someone spreads while being
<i>absolutely aware that it is not true</i> (Media Defence). Assuming that collecting various data for research is going
to stay online, I see possible risks for both of those types of false information spreading. Controlling and
<b>gatekeeping information</b> can be another huge threat: if we expect for <b>Artificial Intellect capabilities</b> to progress,
countries like Russia, already described as “the cyber gulag” (Euronews), or China (RSF) and their leaders can
install even <b>stricter restrictions and surveillance online</b>. This is terrible in both senses - for the locals that
have these restrictions imposed on them, and for the researchers (both inside and outside the countries) who cannot
do their job as well or as safely as possible. Chinese AI chatbots have already started to spread disinformation
that “follow[s] pre‑set scripts on topics Beijing deems sensitive” (RSF). Therefore, there is a risk of being even
more politically inaccurate, and of important intercultural topics silenced as a result. Assuming that authoritarian
regimes detest any opinions or norms that misalign and go against theirs (in other words - since they want to
oppose any kind of interculturalities being maintained and cherished), the field of interculturality can be completely
unrepresented or misrepresented due to false or falsified information available online.
