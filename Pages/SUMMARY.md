<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
To summarize, intercultural studies focus on relations of difference between <i><b>us</b></i> and <i><b>them</b></i>, taking into account
both <i><b>our</b></i> and <i><b>their</b></i> histories and experienced changes, and even though humanities used to follow a more rigid mindset
of putting different groups of people in very particular boxes (ex. Hofstedean approach), in the contemporary world
a lot of attention is paid for in-depth understanding of particular situations and <b>avoiding generalizations</b> as much
as possible. The field that I am currently studying is, in my opinion, very academical, because we are trying to
critically reflect and study otherness, but it has huge practical value - to understand those that seem different
from oneself - in the corporate world or any big- or small-scale social reality that a person needs to face - from
individual interactions of people from different cultural groups to national countries to transnational organizations.</p>

The assignment was written according to the style guide of the English Department in Aarhus University.
It clearly states that the "use of the first person will be relatively infrequent", therefore allowing some usage of it (Aarhus University 11).
