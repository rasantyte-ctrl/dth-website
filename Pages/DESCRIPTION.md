        APIs are defined as “mechanisms that enable two software components <b>to communicate</b> with each other using a set of definitions
        and protocols” (Amazon Web Services (AWS)). They can enhance the experience on any website by providing useful information
        that is constantly updated, for instance, <b>weather reports, anecdotes or pictures of specific keywords</b>. At first, I decided
        to include a <b>“Website Carbon API”</b>, which would calculate how much environmental impact does opening a certain website once
        have: it includes data such as in which percentile the website is based on how clean it is (“cleanerThan” response),
        whether the website is considered “green”, or how many “grams of CO2” were emitted to open the website (Website Carbon).
        Unfortunately, the trials to make this API work on the website created for this assignment were unsuccessful: it was
        possible to create the button, but there must have been lack of communication between those software components, mentioned
        by AWS, for the API to work. I have decided not to keep trying because it was not certain that the API was still 100 %
        functional or was easy enough to be used for a beginner. The second choice of an API was <b>“Giphy”</b>, which allows anyone
        with a free account to use gifs in their websites. It proved to be possible to create a new API key based on provided
        instructions to follow GIPHY Developer Dashboard page (GIPHY Developers). This key is used in the code to create a link
        between the randomly generated gif files and the website created for the assignment. The results of the API can be seen
        on the next menu item (APIs), with 4 separate gif containers that generate a random gif based on the keywords: <b>'politics', 'culture',
        'intercultural', 'diplomacy'</b>.
<br><br>
        Using this particular API can be useful for interculturalists because the chosen keywords will inevitably portray memes
        or other moving pictures that relate to them. Since the API has a huge data of gifs, it can be used as a quantitative
        resource while analyzing interculturality, culture and related topics and actors / politicians / artists involved.
