<p><strong>Essential to learn: technologies in intercultural studies</strong><br><br>
The only cure from such gatekeeping of information and access to people is using <b>critical, computational thinking</b>,
and <b>embracing the real world</b>. We, researchers, have to ask ourselves: is there any possible intent for the informants
to hide or change facts? How to create trustworthy relationships with informants online? How to trust textual
information, photos and videos as new technologies’ quality to generate them with AI improves? Asking these
questions becomes an important task for everyone who works or plans to work / study in the intercultural field.
Jeannette M. Wing states that computational thinking can help us “reformulat[e] a seemingly difficult problem into
one we know how to solve“ (33). Since people are able to “build systems with functionality limited only by our
imaginations“ (35), it suggests possible tampering with certain functionalities - so it is crucial to keep questioning
how each new technology, created by humans, works, what it possibly gatekeepers, and how human biases get integrated
into them. Yet another problem, stemming out of this, is that people can then use these imperfect & possibly-tampered-with
technologies. <br><br></p>
<p><strong>Can the field be immune to change?</strong><br><br>
Due to the inability to generalize research findings in different contexts, interculturalists will always be
necessary to study different people cooperating in a certain time and place. As long as there is no technology,
which could evaluate every single person’s relation to another individual, an interculturalist will be necessary
like, in my terms, <i><b>a social psychologist</b></i> who tries to unravel the social situation, put it in understandable-for-humans
words, and solve intercultural problems or notice interculturally available opportunities. Because of that, my
opinion stands firmly that, unless we reach a dystopian reality with technology dominating over all of our privacy,
including thoughts and biases, interculturality will be a field that is more-or-less immune to changes in the
technological sector. That is, of course, if researchers and interculturalists learn to skim through (or rather
swim through) the ever-filling sea of mis- and disinformation until personal truths are found, possibly while
using the computational thinking method, and not forgetting to face people in the real world.
