  <p><strong>Briefly: Intercultural studies</strong><br>
  To introduce the reader to the context of my study field, I would like to define what interculturality is. Dietz (2018) describes interculturality as “the relations that exist between the culturally diverse human groups that comprise a given society” (1). This term should not be mixed with the term multiculturalism - “the belief that different cultures within a society should all be given importance” (Cambridge Dictionary). Studying interculturality presupposes the importance of multiculturalism, as researchers in the field value multicultural realities of our ever-more socially and globally connected world. Rozbicki (2015) believes that those relations of different people are “ultimately a relation of difference”, and that those different cultural realities were never “universal” but, on the contrary, “conventional, generated” (1),- therefore, it is important to study difference, otherness in this study field alongside the changes that cultures go through during their existence. As a researcher in the field, I have the responsibility to look at cultures with the perspective that they have been constantly developing and were never static - which is why Hofstede, who created a categorization system for analyzing national cultures from all over the world, eventually lost humanitarians’ respect for his “‘othering’ Hofstedean approaches” (Ybema, 37). That happened because such functionalist and reductionistic approaches lost their popularity and became cancelled due to recognizing that a group of people in a nation cannot have “the collective programming of the mind that distinguishes the members of one group or category of people from others” (Hofstede, qtd. in Ybema 38). Such critique eventually created a more “flexible interpretive space” (Ailon, qtd. in Ybema 39), which abolished the perception of “the native’s point of view”, although Hofstede’s uncritical method still gets attraction due to their “affordable answers to existing corporate needs” (43).</p>
