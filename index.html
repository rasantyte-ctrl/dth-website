        <p><strong>New possible technological disruptions to the field’s practices</strong><br><br>
        As mentioned in the previous chapter, more and more information can be found online as people not only are,
        but <i>live</i> in online spaces. One of the biggest threats that I can notice to the field is <b>difficulties to obtain
        trustworthy information</b>. Misinformation, disinformation and mal-information are not new concepts, but I believe that
        new technologies (ex. deep-fakes) can make it progressively more difficult to find reliable information as technology
        improves. The main difference between the previously mentioned terms is that <b>misinformation</b> is something false that
        a person spreads while <i>believing</i> in it; meanwhile <b>disinformation</b> is any information that someone spreads while being
        <i>absolutely aware that it is not true</i> (Media Defence). Assuming that collecting various data for research is going
        to stay online, I see possible risks for both of those types of false information spreading. Controlling and
        <b>gatekeeping information</b> can be another huge threat: if we expect for <b>Artificial Intellect capabilities</b> to progress,
        countries like Russia, already described as “the cyber gulag” (Euronews), or China (RSF) and their leaders can
        install even <b>stricter restrictions and surveillance online</b>. This is terrible in both senses - for the locals that
        have these restrictions imposed on them, and for the researchers (both inside and outside the countries) who cannot
        do their job as well or as safely as possible. Chinese AI chatbots have already started to spread disinformation
        that “follow[s] pre‑set scripts on topics Beijing deems sensitive” (RSF). Therefore, there is a risk of being even
        more politically inaccurate, and of important intercultural topics silenced as a result. Assuming that authoritarian
        regimes detest any opinions or norms that misalign and go against theirs (in other words - since they want to
        oppose any kind of interculturalities being maintained and cherished), the field of interculturality can be completely
        unrepresented or misrepresented due to false or falsified information available online.

    <div id="page4" class="page">
        <p><strong>Essential to learn: technologies in intercultural studies</strong><br><br>
        The only cure from such gatekeeping of information and access to people is using <b>critical, computational thinking</b>,
        and <b>embracing the real world</b>. We, researchers, have to ask ourselves: is there any possible intent for the informants
        to hide or change facts? How to create trustworthy relationships with informants online? How to trust textual
        information, photos and videos as new technologies’ quality to generate them with AI improves? Asking these
        questions becomes an important task for everyone who works or plans to work / study in the intercultural field.
        Jeannette M. Wing states that computational thinking can help us “reformulat[e] a seemingly difficult problem into
        one we know how to solve“ (33). Since people are able to “build systems with functionality limited only by our
        imaginations“ (35), it suggests possible tampering with certain functionalities - so it is crucial to keep questioning
        how each new technology, created by humans, works, what it possibly gatekeepers, and how human biases get integrated
        into them. Yet another problem, stemming out of this, is that people can then use these imperfect & possibly-tampered-with
        technologies. <br><br></p>
        <p><strong>Can the field be immune to change?</strong><br><br>
          Due to the inability to generalize research findings in different contexts, interculturalists will always be
          necessary to study different people cooperating in a certain time and place. As long as there is no technology,
          which could evaluate every single person’s relation to another individual, an interculturalist will be necessary
          like, in my terms, <i><b>a social psychologist</b></i> who tries to unravel the social situation, put it in understandable-for-humans
          words, and solve intercultural problems or notice interculturally available opportunities. Because of that, my
          opinion stands firmly that, unless we reach a dystopian reality with technology dominating over all of our privacy,
          including thoughts and biases, interculturality will be a field that is more-or-less immune to changes in the
          technological sector. That is, of course, if researchers and interculturalists learn to skim through (or rather
          swim through) the ever-filling sea of mis- and disinformation until personal truths are found, possibly while
          using the computational thinking method, and not forgetting to face people in the real world.

        <br>
      <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
        To summarize, intercultural studies focus on relations of difference between <i><b>us</b></i> and <i><b>them</b></i>, taking into account
        both <i><b>our</b></i> and <i><b>their</b></i> histories and experienced changes, and even though humanities used to follow a more rigid mindset
        of putting different groups of people in very particular boxes (ex. Hofstedean approach), in the contemporary world
        a lot of attention is paid for in-depth understanding of particular situations and <b>avoiding generalizations</b> as much
        as possible. The field that I am currently studying is, in my opinion, very academical, because we are trying to
        critically reflect and study otherness, but it has huge practical value - to understand those that seem different
        from oneself - in the corporate world or any big- or small-scale social reality that a person needs to face - from
        individual interactions of people from different cultural groups to national countries to transnational organizations.</p>
        <p><strong>An important note:</strong><br>
        The assignment was written according to the style guide of the English Department in Aarhus University.
        It clearly states that the "use of the first person will be relatively infrequent", therefore allowing some usage of it (Aarhus University 11).

        <p><strong>🤔 APIs DESCRIPTION</strong><br><br>
        APIs are defined as “mechanisms that enable two software components <b>to communicate</b> with each other using a set of definitions
        and protocols” (Amazon Web Services (AWS)). They can enhance the experience on any website by providing useful information
        that is constantly updated, for instance, <b>weather reports, anecdotes or pictures of specific keywords</b>. At first, I decided
        to include a <b>“Website Carbon API”</b>, which would calculate how much environmental impact does opening a certain website once
        have: it includes data such as in which percentile the website is based on how clean it is (“cleanerThan” response),
        whether the website is considered “green”, or how many “grams of CO2” were emitted to open the website (Website Carbon).
        Unfortunately, the trials to make this API work on the website created for this assignment were unsuccessful: it was
        possible to create the button, but there must have been lack of communication between those software components, mentioned
        by AWS, for the API to work. I have decided not to keep trying because it was not certain that the API was still 100 %
        functional or was easy enough to be used for a beginner. The second choice of an API was <b>“Giphy”</b>, which allows anyone
        with a free account to use gifs in their websites. It proved to be possible to create a new API key based on provided
        instructions to follow GIPHY Developer Dashboard page (GIPHY Developers). This key is used in the code to create a link
        between the randomly generated gif files and the website created for the assignment. The results of the API can be seen
        on the next menu item (APIs), with 4 separate gif containers that generate a random gif based on the keywords: <b>'politics', 'culture',
        'intercultural', 'diplomacy'</b>.
<br><br>
        Using this particular API can be useful for interculturalists because the chosen keywords will inevitably portray memes
        or other moving pictures that relate to them. Since the API has a huge data of gifs, it can be used as a quantitative
        resource while analyzing interculturality, culture and related topics and actors / politicians / artists involved.
