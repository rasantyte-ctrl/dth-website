        <p><strong>Briefly: Intercultural studies</strong><br><br>
        To introduce the reader to the context of my study field, I would like to define what interculturality
        is. Dietz (2018) describes <b>interculturality</b> as “the relations that exist between the culturally
        diverse human groups that comprise a given society” (1). This term should not be mixed with the term
        <b>multiculturalism</b> - “the belief that different cultures within a society should all be given
        importance” (Cambridge Dictionary). Studying interculturality presupposes the importance of
        multiculturalism, as researchers in the field value multicultural realities of our ever-more
        socially and globally connected world. Rozbicki (2015) believes that those relations of different
        people are “ultimately a relation of difference”, and that those different cultural realities were
        never “universal” but, on the contrary, “conventional, generated” (1),- therefore, it is important
        to study <b>difference, otherness</b> in this study field alongside <b>the changes</b> that cultures go through
        during their existence.<br><br>
        As a researcher in the field, I have the responsibility to look at cultures
        with the perspective that they have been constantly developing and were never static - which is why
        Hofstede, who created a categorization system for analyzing national cultures from all over the world,
        eventually lost humanitarians’ respect for his “<b>‘othering’ Hofstedean approaches</b>” (Ybema, 37). That
        happened because such functionalist and reductionistic approaches lost their popularity and became
        cancelled due to recognizing that a group of people in a nation cannot have “the collective
        programming of the mind that distinguishes the members of one group or category of people from
        others” (Hofstede, qtd. in Ybema 38). Such critique eventually created a more “flexible interpretive
        space” (Ailon, qtd. in Ybema 39), which abolished the perception of “the native’s point of view”,
        although Hofstede’s uncritical method still gets attraction due to their “affordable answers to
        existing corporate needs” (43).</p>

        <p><strong>Digital technologies & intercultural studies</strong><br><br>
        In this chapter I will focus on one of the ways to currently use digital technologies within the field:
          while being a student / researcher. I will not take into account the ways to use it while applying
          knowledge from the field in the workplace, because, after graduation from such a university program,
          each work situation may be different, and the use of digital technologies may differ drastically.
          Additionally, my narrow view and lack of experience could lead to overgeneralization or an overly
          black-and-white vision to things.<br><br>
        During my studies in Aarhus University, in daily life I have always noticed that the students have the
        freedom to choose which technological devices they want to use in class. <b>A laptop or a digital tablet</b>
        can be useful to have in the classroom, but it is not mandatory - although writing often lengthy papers
        requires having a physically comfortable way to prepare those digital hand-ins. We also need <b>internet
        access</b> to open <b>“BrightSpace” or “WISEflow”</b> in order to access information about courses or exams - for
        that we also need to have our individual profiles created by the university. Our accounts allow us to
        go through <b>APIs</b> (or Application Programming Interfaces) to access important information as we log in
        to those websites’ personal accounts via our university emails and passwords. Moreover, to access
        certain articles or study books in “AU Library”, we need to prove that we are students, so certain
        identifying information is passed through the <b>“WAYF”</b> (“Where are you from”) <b>interface</b>. Using <b>uCloud</b>
        can help protect files and work progress, but, in my humble opinion, it is not necessary or it can
        easily be constituted by using <b>“Google Docs”</b> / another similar website that allows one to write text
        and save progress immediately on the cloud. Although using uCloud can be safer than relying on
        “Google” services: for example, Vienna University “strongly advises against using external cloud
        services, such as Dropbox, Google Drive” or others as they provide “u:cloud” service (Vienna
        University Computer Center). I will draw an assumption that it must be due to possible security
        or privacy issues.<br><br>
        It may seem that there are some freedoms in regards to using digital technologies for our studies, but
        it is only an illusion due to our dependence on information not only in theoretical articles and study
        books, but in studying people’s behaviours in social media. “We No Longer Go Online, We Live Online”
        (Chorn) is an insightful saying, which will force students and researchers to follow various groups’
        activities <b>online</b> in order to find relevant problems and access to people.

        <p><strong>New possible technological disruptions to the field’s practices</strong><br><br>
        As mentioned in the previous chapter, more and more information can be found online as people not only are,
        but <i>live</i> in online spaces. One of the biggest threats that I can notice to the field is <b>difficulties to obtain
        trustworthy information</b>. Misinformation, disinformation and mal-information are not new concepts, but I believe that
        new technologies (ex. deep-fakes) can make it progressively more difficult to find reliable information as technology
        improves. The main difference between the previously mentioned terms is that <b>misinformation</b> is something false that
        a person spreads while <i>believing</i> in it; meanwhile <b>disinformation</b> is any information that someone spreads while being
        <i>absolutely aware that it is not true</i> (Media Defence). Assuming that collecting various data for research is going
        to stay online, I see possible risks for both of those types of false information spreading. Controlling and
        <b>gatekeeping information</b> can be another huge threat: if we expect for <b>Artificial Intellect capabilities</b> to progress,
        countries like Russia, already described as “the cyber gulag” (Euronews), or China (RSF) and their leaders can
        install even <b>stricter restrictions and surveillance online</b>. This is terrible in both senses - for the locals that
        have these restrictions imposed on them, and for the researchers (both inside and outside the countries) who cannot
        do their job as well or as safely as possible. Chinese AI chatbots have already started to spread disinformation
        that “follow[s] pre‑set scripts on topics Beijing deems sensitive” (RSF). Therefore, there is a risk of being even
        more politically inaccurate, and of important intercultural topics silenced as a result. Assuming that authoritarian
        regimes detest any opinions or norms that misalign and go against theirs (in other words - since they want to
        oppose any kind of interculturalities being maintained and cherished), the field of interculturality can be completely
        unrepresented or misrepresented due to false or falsified information available online.

    <div id="page4" class="page">
        <p><strong>Essential to learn: technologies in intercultural studies</strong><br><br>
        The only cure from such gatekeeping of information and access to people is using <b>critical, computational thinking</b>,
        and <b>embracing the real world</b>. We, researchers, have to ask ourselves: is there any possible intent for the informants
        to hide or change facts? How to create trustworthy relationships with informants online? How to trust textual
        information, photos and videos as new technologies’ quality to generate them with AI improves? Asking these
        questions becomes an important task for everyone who works or plans to work / study in the intercultural field.
        Jeannette M. Wing states that computational thinking can help us “reformulat[e] a seemingly difficult problem into
        one we know how to solve“ (33). Since people are able to “build systems with functionality limited only by our
        imaginations“ (35), it suggests possible tampering with certain functionalities - so it is crucial to keep questioning
        how each new technology, created by humans, works, what it possibly gatekeepers, and how human biases get integrated
        into them. Yet another problem, stemming out of this, is that people can then use these imperfect & possibly-tampered-with
        technologies. <br><br></p>
        <p><strong>Can the field be immune to change?</strong><br><br>
          Due to the inability to generalize research findings in different contexts, interculturalists will always be
          necessary to study different people cooperating in a certain time and place. As long as there is no technology,
          which could evaluate every single person’s relation to another individual, an interculturalist will be necessary
          like, in my terms, <i><b>a social psychologist</b></i> who tries to unravel the social situation, put it in understandable-for-humans
          words, and solve intercultural problems or notice interculturally available opportunities. Because of that, my
          opinion stands firmly that, unless we reach a dystopian reality with technology dominating over all of our privacy,
          including thoughts and biases, interculturality will be a field that is more-or-less immune to changes in the
          technological sector. That is, of course, if researchers and interculturalists learn to skim through (or rather
          swim through) the ever-filling sea of mis- and disinformation until personal truths are found, possibly while
          using the computational thinking method, and not forgetting to face people in the real world.

        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>
        To summarize, intercultural studies focus on relations of difference between <i><b>us</b></i> and <i><b>them</b></i>, taking into account
        both <i><b>our</b></i> and <i><b>their</b></i> histories and experienced changes, and even though humanities used to follow a more rigid mindset
        of putting different groups of people in very particular boxes (ex. Hofstedean approach), in the contemporary world
        a lot of attention is paid for in-depth understanding of particular situations and <b>avoiding generalizations</b> as much
        as possible. The field that I am currently studying is, in my opinion, very academical, because we are trying to
        critically reflect and study otherness, but it has huge practical value - to understand those that seem different
        from oneself - in the corporate world or any big- or small-scale social reality that a person needs to face - from
        individual interactions of people from different cultural groups to national countries to transnational organizations.
